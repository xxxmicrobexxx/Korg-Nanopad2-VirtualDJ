This is mapping for the Korg nanopad2 in Virtual DJ.

The default mapping that is included with VDJ has an error: Scene 3 Pad 8 code is "effect_select 'FlippinDouble' & effect_active 'FlippinDouble'", it should be "Flippin Double".

But beside that, the default mapping isn't all that useful.  

I am pretty certain that this mapping will be updated as I use the nanopad2 a bit.

Your suggestions are welcome.
